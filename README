DESCRIPTION:
This project was to build a small working webserver, that could serve up http requests. The requests fully supported are GET and HEAD. If a user requests a file within the "website" directory, then the server will send an http response back with the requested information.


COMMENTS:
Interesting trying to figure out all the different ways you have to construct/analyze requests for simple web servers.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
The only problems we know that exist is that different file types are not currently working. I believe this to be a simple problem with opening the files in the right mode, but we did not get the chance to fix this problem.

DESIGN:
The code is setup to initialize a socket with a port, and wait for an incoming connection. Once a connection is found, the program parses the request and determines if it's valid, and if the requested file exists/permissions/etc... If everything comes back OK the server will respond with the requested information, if there was an error, the server will respond with the proper HTTP code for the error.
